**Project by: Chintamani Chaudhari (PRN: 22070521138)**
**Course: Machine Learning Mini Project (CA4)**

This is the repository for my end-to-end Machine Learning project. This project analyzes a dataset of 6,400 Spotify songs from the 2010s to build a "Musician's Co-Pilot"â€”a 3-part toolkit to help artists make data-driven decisions during the songwriting process.

## ðŸš€ The Final Application
The primary output is a live web application built with Streamlit.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem & The Need

### The Problem
For a musician or record label, the success of a new song is a "black box." Millions are invested into producing and promoting tracks with no guarantee of success. It's difficult to know what separates a "Hit" from a "Flop" and even harder to know how to *fix* a song that isn't performing well.

### The Need
Musicians need a data-driven toolkit that goes beyond a simple "yes/no" prediction. They need **actionable insights** to:
1.  **Forecast** a new song's potential before it's released.
2.  Get **guidance** on *how to improve* a song that is predicted to be a "Flop."
3.  Understand the **underlying "formulas"** that successful songs share.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution: The "Musician's Co-Pilot"
This project is built as a 3-part toolkit, with each model solving the next logical problem for a musician.

### 1. The Predictor (Classification)
* **Question:** "Will my new song be a 'Hit' or a 'Flop'?"
* **Logic:** Our **EDA** (`ML_EDA_22070521138.ipynb`) showed that no single feature (like `energy` or `loudness`) could predict a hit. This proved we needed an advanced model.
* **Solution:** We built and tuned multiple models (`Classification Model Selection.ipynb`). The winner was a **Tuned XGBoost Classifier** that achieved an **85.3% F1-Score**. This is the "brain" inside our Streamlit app.

### 2. The Engineer (Regression)
* **Question:** "My song is a 'Flop'. How do I *fix* it?"
* **Logic:** The "Predictor" model's feature importance plot (`image_18073f.png`) showed that **`danceability`** is one of the *most critical* features for a hit. However, a musician can't "turn up a danceability knob"â€”it's an *outcome* of other features they *can* control (like `tempo`, `energy`, etc.).
* **Solution:** We built an **XGBoost Regressor** (`ML Regression.ipynb`) that predicts a song's `danceability` based on its other features with **77% R-Squared accuracy**. This allows a musician to use it as a "what-if" engine to see how tweaking their song's mix can improve its danceability.

### 3. The Formula (Clustering)
* **Question:** "What *are* the secret formulas I'm aiming for?"
* **Logic:** Our EDA plots (`image_328fc2.png`, `image_328fe2.png`) showed that songs are not all one type (e.g., `instrumentalness` is mostly zero, `acousticness` has two peaks). This proves there are hidden groups.
* **Solution:** We used **K-Means Clustering** (`ML Clustering.ipynb`) to analyze all 6,400 songs. The model discovered **4 distinct "song formulas"**:
    * **Formula A ("The Standard Hit"):** 57% Hit Rate. High energy, loud, standard structure.
    * **Formula B ("The Simple Hit"):** 53% Hit Rate. High danceability, loud, *simple* structure.
    * **Formula C ("The Niche Flop"):** 17% Hit Rate. Quieter, more complex (e.g., Jazz, Ambient).
    * **Formula D ("The Super-Flop"):** 4% Hit Rate. Very quiet, *very* complex (e.g., Metal, Live Jazz).
